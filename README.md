# Classification-Regression-Models
Classification Regression Models (Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers)

In this project, we will explore how we can develop an intepretable and explainable machine learning application on the example of classification regression models such
as a Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifiers.

### Below are the key objectives of this project:
1.	Create an intepretable machine learning application in Python.
2.	Select, run, evaluate and compare two different classification regression models.
3.	Extract, which features are the most important ones for our classification regressors.
4.	Show how the values of a particular important feature may affect predictions being made.


### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ Setting the stage and be familair with the data.
- __Task 2:__ Making Predictions with a Decision Tree Classifier
- __Task 3:__ Making Predictions with a Random Forest Classifier
- __Task 4:__ Extracting most impactful features
- __Task 5:__ Extracting the most influential values of impactful features
